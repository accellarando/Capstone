			<h1>Vertial Paint Pen-Plotter</h1>
			<p>The plotter for TagGang was comprised of custom-fitted 3D prints, a vertically-elongated rolling whiteboard, 2-phase 1.8 degree/step stepper motors, timing belt and pulley, ball bearings, alongside the various wires and power adapters.<br>
			This cable-driven plotter mounts stepper motors to the top corners of the whiteboard. The timing belt is threaded through the mounts, interlocking with the timing pulleys on each stepper motor, and ending with a counterweight that holds pennies.
			The other end of the belt is attached to an arm of the gondola. The gondola holds the paint pen and servo motor that lifts the gondola off the paper. Long wires connect the motors to the custom Pi Hat hardware to drive them.<br>
			</p>

			<h2>Demo Day Plotter</h2>
			<p>TagGang's final version of the plotter utilized the CADE lab's vertically-elongated plotter, wrapped with 6' of white butcher paper.<br>
			Connecting wires and power adapters not shown in the picture below, but were laid out on the table.<br>

			<h2>Plotter Versions</h2>
			<p>The plotter build went through various iterations and the original build was ultimately scrapped. The original design was geared toward a width-elongated rolling frame as seen in the design:<br>

			This first verion was constructed out of PVC pipes and the backing was either cardboard or poster foam board.<br>
			The PVC frame was constructed but finding the backing proved to be expensive. Custom sized boards would be an additional cost we didn't want to splurge on. Trying to use recycled cardboard and poster foam boards made an uneven surface:<br>

			We then received a thin whiteboard from our professor but was too flimsy and could not hold the weight of the stepper motors:<br>

			<h2>3D-Prints</h2>
			<p>There were multiple versions of the 3D-prints due to the verious versions of the plotter. The working and final 3D prints can be found in our repo within <a href="https://github.com/accellarando/TagGang/tree/selector-commands/plotter-frame">selector-commands branch in plotter-frame</a>.<br>
