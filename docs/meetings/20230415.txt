We have some kinect skeleton tracking code but not sure if it works yet

Dana: work on arduino code:
	https://github.com/stm32duino/X-NUCLEO-IHM01A1
1. Simple program that accepts stepper motor commands from the command line and sends them to arduino
2. Once we have that, we can call that program from the kinect code to control the stepper motor

Overview of final interface:
E Kinect will send information to computer
E Computer translates that information to a stepper motor command, e.g. "-3" or "24"
R Then, this program calls a script to send the stepper motor command to the arduino over serial:
	./stepper_control.py -3
R The Arduino picks up this serial command
R Arduino sends serial command to stepper driver
R Stepper motor moves to desired position
