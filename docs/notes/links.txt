There are features in TagGang's Kinect not found in the libfreenect SDK base build that we would like to explore further through the means of other SDK integrations like finger/palm detection.

--- TO DO

CHANGE PEN PLOTTER TO PAINT-PEN PLOTTER

    % FIXME: The Kinect v2 face recognition, motion tracking, and resolution are much more precise than the Kinect v1
    % FIXME: No finger tracking
    % FIXME: DIFFERENT GESTURES -  Draw/move without drawing: hold out hand in front of you while drawing, pull back to stop? As a backup, if that doesn't work - hide your left hand to stop drawing Finish - button on lower right corner of screen? Punch with left hand? or a timer
    % FIXME: NOISE FROM GESTURE
    % FIXME: FAST ENOUGH MOVEMENT

MILESTONE 3 OCT 27

After Ella provides the blank PCB and electrical components,
Dana will solder the necessary electrical components---following the PCB schematic---that satisfy the specifications
in creating the PCB for the CNC controller. 
At the very most, this process should take 1 week: this accounts for any mistakes made while soldering as well as constant testing to avoid any electrical mishaps.

The completed custom PCB CNC controller attached to the Arduino Uno. 

Ella will create custom 3D-printed parts given by Dana's plotter design specifications which will take 1 week.
 
The design includes the frame's bar and attachments for the stepper motor and toothed cable housing, paint-pen holder, and counterweights.
Then Dana will assemble the plotter's hardware setup and connect it to the rest of the TagGang system in a temporary
environment within 1 week.

Modifications to GRBL for polar plotting should be ready in 1 week within the given time frame and before testing 
of the assembled plotter. 

The temporary environment will allow basic testing of the plotter which is conducted by both members and
subsequently documented, taking 1 week.
